                    According to the CDC, Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native (AI/AN) women are two to three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women. This disparity increases with age. Most pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. Racial and ethnic disparities in pregnancy-related deaths have persisted over time.

                    There are numerous factors contributing to these outcomes; poverty, racism, lack of prenatal care, lack of access to the best hospitals and doctors. Black women face racism in many environments, but racism directed at Black patients from the medical field often goes unnoticed or unaddressed. Black women feel the stress of racism in their daily lives. When Black women are pregnant, this stress can be detrimental to their health and the health of their babies. In fact, this stress and its causes are life threatening.

                    According to wellness writer, Patia Braithwaite, “the term ‘<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16380565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weathering</a>’ describes how the constant stress of racism may lead to premature biological aging and poor health outcomes for Black people, like <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternal-mortality/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Freproductivehealth%2Fmaternalinfanthealth%2Fpregnancy-mortality-surveillance-system.htm
                    " target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disproportionately high death rates</a> from chronic conditions.” From advocacy to pain management, we know that Black women routinely receive inadequate care from the moment they step into a care facility.
